# VoiceTransplant
Patches to port Gynoid/Internet voices to VOICEROID2. In this way, you can keep all your voices in VOICEROID2.

Keep in mind that you still need a valid license for the voice, and a license for VOICEROID2, to use the voice.

These patches are created by Ulysses and released under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** license. Please, keep author's name while sharing with others.
